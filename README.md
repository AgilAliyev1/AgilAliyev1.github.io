# Agil Aliyev - Personal Website (Capstone Project 2)

## 🌟 Project Overview

This is my personal website showcasing my journey as a web developer, cybersecurity enthusiast, and IT student at ADA University. Built as part of Capstone Project 2, this website demonstrates advanced CSS styling, layout techniques, and modern web development practices.

## 🎯 What I've Accomplished

### Part 1: CSS Styling (Week 03 Objectives)
- ✅ **Unified External Stylesheet**: Created a comprehensive `style.css` connected to all pages
- ✅ **Consistent Design**: Applied same background color and font style across all pages
- ✅ **Body Layout**: Set body to 90% browser width and centered it
- ✅ **Enhanced Horizontal Rules**: Styled to be shorter, thicker, and dotted/dashed, centered horizontally
- ✅ **Profile Picture Styling**: Made circular (200px × 200px) with hover effect growing to 220px × 220px
- ✅ **Table Styling**: Applied comprehensive CSS table styling to Education page
- ✅ **List Styling**: Enhanced lists with hover effects and custom markers
- ✅ **Form Styling**: Styled Contact Me page forms with focus states and validation
- ✅ **Pseudo-classes & Elements**: Implemented `:hover`, `:focus`, `:invalid`, `:valid`, `:disabled` and `::before`, `::after`, `::marker`
- ✅ **Google Fonts**: Integrated Inter font family for modern typography

### Part 2: CSS Layouts (Week 04 Objectives)
- ✅ **Multiple Layout Versions**: Created three different versions of the Education page:
  - **Float + Position Layout** (`education-float.html`)
  - **Flexbox Layout** (`education-flex.html`) 
  - **Grid Layout** (`education.html`)
- ✅ **Layout Comparison**: Each version demonstrates different CSS layout techniques while maintaining the same content

### Part 3: Unified Navigation
- ✅ **Sticky Navigation**: Navbar stays fixed at the top when scrolling
- ✅ **Hover Effects**: Navigation links change style on hover
- ✅ **Active Page Styling**: Current page link is styled differently and doesn't change on hover
- ✅ **Responsive Navigation**: Adapts to mobile devices with proper layout

### Part 4: Gallery & Responsiveness
- ✅ **Photo Gallery**: Added gallery page with 6+ images (gaming setup, coding environment, sports, hobbies, profile, projects)
- ✅ **Responsive Design**: Implemented media queries for different screen sizes
  - **Desktop**: 3 images per row
  - **Mobile**: 1 image per row
- ✅ **Interactive Gallery**: Hover effects and smooth transitions

### Part 5: Bootstrap Integration
- ✅ **Bootstrap CDN**: Added Bootstrap 5.3.3 via CDN link
- ✅ **Bootstrap Components**: Used Bootstrap grid system, cards, alerts, and utility classes
- ✅ **Comparison**: Created both Bootstrap and custom CSS versions for comparison
- ✅ **Bootstrap Features Used**:
  - Grid system (`row row-cols-1 row-cols-md-3 g-4`)
  - Cards (`card h-100 shadow-sm`)
  - Alert component (`alert alert-info`)
  - Utility classes (`mb-4`, `mb-5`, `text-muted`)

### Part 6: Deployment & Documentation
- ✅ **Comprehensive README**: This documentation file
- ✅ **GitHub Pages Ready**: Optimized for deployment
